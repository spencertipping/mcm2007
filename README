Here is my solution to the 2007 mathematical contest in modeling. This was
written in about 72 hours (hence the suboptimal code quality) and without much
background in Python (hence the unidiomatic code).

model.py was the original attempt, and I rewrote it as model2.py to run the
final simulations.

I don't remember exactly how to use it, but I remember tweaking the last
couple of lines in various ways to get it to run with different parameters.
